# keyof Type Operator
```ts
type Arrayish = { [n: number]: unknown };
type A = keyof Arrayish; // type A = number
 
type Mapish = { [k: string]: boolean };
type M = keyof Mapish; // type M = string | number
```

Note that in this example, M is string | number â€” this is because JavaScript object keys are always coerced to a string, so obj[0] is always the same as obj["0"].
